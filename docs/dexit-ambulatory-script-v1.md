Ambulatory/Smaller Organizations Call Flow
(The "Whoever Is In Charge" Script)

OPENING (Simple & Accessible)
Version 1 (Universal Pain Point):
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from 314e. We help medical practices handle patient documents faster - things like referrals, lab results, faxes - using AI so your staff doesn't have to do it all manually. I'm calling because in smaller practices, these tasks eat up a lot of time. Do you have a quick minute?"
Version 2 (Direct & Simple):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. Quick question - when patient documents come in - whether it's faxes, referrals, test results - how much time is your staff spending just getting those organized and into your system?"
Version 3 (Relatable Problem):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] with 314e. I've been talking to a lot of medical practices, and they're telling me their staff is spending hours every day sorting faxes, matching documents to patients, and getting everything filed. Is that something you're dealing with too?"
Version 4 (Helpful Approach):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. We work with medical practices to cut down on paperwork and manual tasks using AI. I'm calling to see if there's anything about how you handle patient documents that's slowing your team down or taking up too much time. Got a minute?"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Simple & Conversational)
Smaller practices = people wear multiple hats. Keep questions simple and relatable:

"What system are you using for your patient records - is it Epic, Athena, eClinicalWorks, something else?"

Why: Need to know their tech

"How do most of your documents come in - mostly faxes, or do you get a lot of scans and uploads too?"

Why: Identify intake channels

"When a document comes in - let's say a referral from another doctor or lab results - what happens next? Walk me through it."

Let them talk - they'll tell you their pain

"Who on your staff handles that - is it your medical assistants, front desk, nurses?"

Why: Understand who's burdened

"About how many of those documents are coming in each day or each week?"

Why: Volume understanding

"How much time would you say your staff spends on that every day - just sorting, matching, and filing documents?"

Why: Time = money for small practices

"What's the most frustrating part of that process for your team?"

Why: Find the real pain point

"Are you using any kind of system to help with that, or is it pretty much all manual work?"

Why: Current state assessment

"If you could snap your fingers and fix one thing about how you handle documents, what would it be?"

Why: Dream scenario = their priority

TRANSITION TO PITCH
Keep it simple and relatable. Use their language back at them:
If they mention time-consuming work:
"Yeah, that's what we hear constantly. Here's what we do: our system uses AI to handle all of that automatically. When a document comes in, the AI reads it, figures out what it is, matches it to the right patient, and files it where it needs to go - all without your staff having to touch it. So instead of spending hours on paperwork, your team can focus on patients."
If they mention fax chaos:
"Faxes are the worst, right? Our system includes a virtual fax server, so you're not dealing with fax machines anymore. Everything comes in digitally, and the AI automatically sorts it, figures out which patient it belongs to, and routes it to the right person. Your staff just reviews exceptions, not every single fax."
If they mention errors/wrong charts:
"That's a huge problem when everything's manual - it's so easy for things to get misfiled. Our AI is actually trained specifically on medical documents, so it's really accurate at matching documents to the right patient. It catches things that might get missed when people are rushing. Way fewer errors."
If they mention referrals specifically:
"Referrals are perfect for this. Right now, someone has to read the referral, figure out who the patient is, check insurance, schedule them, and make sure everything gets documented. Our AI can automatically capture all that information from the referral, verify insurance, and route it to whoever needs to schedule the patient. Cuts the time down from 10-15 minutes per referral to maybe 2 minutes."
If they mention small team/wearing multiple hats:
"Right, and in a smaller practice, everyone's doing a little bit of everything. That's exactly why automation helps so much. When the AI is handling the repetitive document work, your staff has more time for everything else they're juggling. It's like adding an extra person to your team, but you're not paying benefits or taking up office space."
If they mention insurance verification/prior auth:
"Insurance is such a headache. Our system can automatically pull insurance information from cards when they're faxed or scanned, and it can even connect to verify eligibility automatically. Same with prior auths - the AI captures the information and routes it where it needs to go. Way less back-and-forth."

THE ASK
Keep it simple and low-pressure:
"Here's what I'd like to do: Let me connect you with one of our specialists who can show you exactly how this would work for your practice. They'll walk through real examples that look like what you're dealing with - referrals, faxes, lab results, whatever you want to see. Usually takes about 20-30 minutes. Would this week or next work better for you?"
Alternative ask (Casual):
"I think you'd really benefit from seeing this in action with your actual setup. Our specialist can show you how much time it would save your team. It's pretty quick - about 20-30 minutes. What does your schedule look like?"
Alternative ask (Problem-focused):
"Want to see how this would actually work for [their specific pain point - referrals/faxes/whatever they mentioned]? Our specialist can walk you through it, and you can ask questions about your specific situation. Usually about 20-30 minutes. Does [day/time] work for you?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
"I'm not the decision maker / I need to talk to [doctor/practice manager/someone else]"
Response:
"I totally understand - these decisions usually need input from a few people. Can I ask - who else would need to be involved?"
Get names, then:
"Here's what I'm thinking: what if we schedule a quick demo and include [doctor/PM/whoever] on the call? That way everyone can see it at once and ask questions. Or would it make more sense for you to see it first and then bring it to them?"
Alternative:
"That makes sense. But here's the thing - you're the one dealing with this every day, right? Even if [doctor/PM] makes the final decision, your opinion is going to matter because you know what's actually working and what's not. Want to see it first so you can speak to it when those conversations happen?"
If they're firm about someone else:
"No problem - who should I be talking to? Can you connect me with them, or would you like me to give them a call?"

"We're all set / We're doing fine"
Response:
"That's great to hear! Just curious - when documents come in, is your system handling that automatically, or is your staff still doing most of that work manually?"
They'll almost always say manually.
"Okay, so even though things are working, your staff is still spending time on it, right? What if I told you that could be happening automatically while your staff does other things? Wouldn't that make 'fine' even better?"
If they resist:
"Fair enough. Let me ask you this - if your staff could save an hour or two every day on paperwork, what would they do with that time?"
They'll mention patient care, scheduling, phone calls, etc.
"Right. So even if things are fine now, this would give them time for those things. Worth a quick look?"

"We don't have budget / We can't afford it"
Response:
"I totally get it - budget is always tight in medical practices. Here's the thing though: what you're spending on staff time to manually process documents - that's money too, right? When we save your team 5-10 hours a week, that's money you're getting back.
Let's at least see what it would look like. Our specialist can show you the cost and the time savings side by side, and then you can decide if it makes sense. If the math doesn't work, no problem. But what if it does? Worth a conversation?"
Alternative:
"I hear you. Can I ask - when does your budget year start? Even if there's no money right now, it might make sense to see this so you can plan for it in the next budget cycle. At least then you'll know what's possible."
Alternative (Small practice reality):
"Budget is always the challenge. But here's what a lot of small practices find: when they add up what they're paying staff to do this manual work - or when they realize they need to hire someone else because of the workload - the cost of automation is actually less. Want to at least see what the numbers look like for your practice?"

"We have [system name - EHR or practice management]"
Response:
"Right, so [system name] is handling your patient records and scheduling. But when documents come in from outside - faxes, referrals, lab results from other facilities - is [system name] automatically processing those, or does someone still need to manually file them?"
They'll say manually.
"Right. That's what we automate. We don't replace [system name] - we just handle all the document processing automatically before it goes into [system name]. So [system name] stays, your staff does less manual work. Make sense?"
If they name a document system (OnBase, etc.):
"Got it. And is [system name] using AI to automatically classify and match documents, or is your staff still doing that part?"
They'll usually say staff does it.
"That's where we come in. We add the AI piece that makes [system name] work better. Your staff only deals with exceptions, not every single document."

"We're looking at [other vendor/solution]"
Response:
"That's great - it's smart to look at options. What are you looking at specifically?"
Listen, then:
"Makes sense. Well, if you're already evaluating solutions, it's probably worth seeing ours too just for comparison, right? That way you're making sure you're picking the best option. Want to add us to your list? It's just 20-30 minutes."
Alternative:
"Perfect timing then. Since you're already in evaluation mode, let's get you a demo so you can compare us side by side with what you're looking at. If we're better, great. If not, at least you'll know for sure. Sound good?"

"Not interested"
Response:
"No problem - can I ask what's behind that? Is it that this doesn't sound relevant to you, or is it just bad timing?"
If timing:
"Fair enough. When would be a better time? We can always circle back when things slow down."
If relevance:
"Got it. Just curious though - you're saying your team isn't spending time on documents? Because if you've figured out how to make that seamless, I'd honestly love to know how."
They'll admit they do spend time.
"Right. So it sounds like maybe 'not interested' is really 'I'm not sure this will actually help' or 'I don't have time to deal with this right now.' What if I could show you in 20 minutes how much time your staff would get back? Would that be worth it?"

"Send me information"
Response:
"I can definitely send you something, but honestly, this is one of those things that's hard to appreciate on paper. When you see the AI actually read a document and automatically file it in real time, it clicks. How about this: let me set up a quick 20-minute demo where you can see it working. After that, I'll send you everything. That way the information actually makes sense. What day works for you?"
If they insist:
"Okay, I'll send something over. What's your email? And what should I focus on - are you most interested in handling faxes, processing referrals, or something else?"
Send it, then follow up in 2-3 days:
"Hey [Name], I sent over that information. Did you get a chance to look at it? These things always make more sense when you see them in action. Want to hop on a quick call this week so I can show you how it would work for your practice?"

"We just use our EHR / We don't need a separate system"
Response:
"Totally fair - you don't want more systems to manage. But here's the thing: your EHR isn't really designed to handle outside documents automatically, right? When a fax comes in or you get a referral from another doctor, someone on your staff still has to manually process it to get it into your EHR. That's what we automate. So you're not adding a system - you're adding automation that makes your EHR work better."
Alternative:
"I get it. But think about it this way: your EHR is where everything lives, but how do documents get there? Someone has to put them there, right? That's the manual work we eliminate. Documents come in, get processed automatically, and then go into your EHR. So you're still using your EHR - we're just making it easier to get stuff into it."

"How much does it cost?"
Response:
"That's a fair question. The pricing depends on how many documents you're processing and what you need it to do. For a practice your size, it's usually pretty affordable - especially when you look at how much time it saves your staff.
The best way to get an accurate number is to have our specialist look at your volume and show you the cost versus the time savings. They can give you real numbers based on your practice. Want to set that up?"
If they push for a number:
"I don't want to throw out a number that's not accurate for your situation. But I can tell you that for most practices, when they see how much staff time they get back, it pays for itself pretty quickly. Let's get you on a call where we can talk real numbers. Does [day/time] work?"

"We're too small for this"
Response:
"Actually, smaller practices benefit the most from this. When you only have a few staff members, every hour counts, right? If we can give your team back 5-10 hours a week that they're spending on paperwork, that's huge for a small practice. You don't need to be a big hospital to use this - it's built for practices like yours."
Alternative:
"I hear that a lot, but here's the reality: small practices are often the ones doing the most manual work because they don't have dedicated staff for every task. That's exactly why automation helps - it's like adding someone to your team without the cost of hiring. Worth seeing what that would look like?"

"We don't process that many documents"
Response:
"That's fine - you don't need to be processing thousands. Even if it's 20-30 documents a day, that's still time your staff is spending that they could be using for patients or other tasks. And honestly, most practices underestimate how many documents they're actually dealing with once you count faxes, referrals, lab results, insurance cards, all of it. Want to see what the time savings would be even for your volume?"

"Our fax machine works fine"
Response:
"I bet it does - but is someone still standing at the fax machine sorting through faxes, figuring out which patient each one belongs to, and filing them? That's the manual work we eliminate. With our virtual fax server, faxes come in digitally and get processed automatically. No more standing at the machine, no more paper jams, no more sorting. Plus you can send and receive faxes from anywhere. Want to see how that works?"

"We're thinking about switching EHRs"
Response:
"Got it - that's a big decision. Here's the thing though: no matter which EHR you go with, you're still going to have outside documents that need processing - faxes, referrals, lab results from other facilities. That doesn't change with a new EHR. Our system works with any EHR, so whether you switch or not, we can help with the document processing piece. And honestly, having automation like this in place before you switch would make the transition easier, not harder."
Alternative:
"That makes sense. When are you planning to switch? It might actually be perfect timing to add document automation now, so when you do switch EHRs, you're not dealing with a backlog of unprocessed documents. Want to at least see how it works?"

"Let me talk to my [doctor/office manager/partner] first"
Response:
"Absolutely - that makes sense. Here's what I'm thinking: what if we just schedule the demo now and include them on the call? That way everyone sees it at once and you can all ask questions together. Would that work?"
If they resist:
"No problem. When do you think you'll have a chance to talk to them? I'll follow up after that to see if it makes sense to schedule something."
Then actually follow up when they say.

CLOSING
"Great! Let me grab a couple of times from you. What's your availability like [this week/next week]?"
Get 2-3 time slots, then:
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite to [email]. You'll meet with [SME name], and they'll show you exactly how this works for a practice like yours - [mention their specific pain point if you know it - faxes/referrals/whatever]. If it makes sense to have anyone else from your team join - your office manager, doctor, anyone - feel free to add them to the invite. Sound good?"

GATEKEEPER HANDLING (Since you'll hit these A LOT in smaller practices)
Receptionist/Front Desk:
"Hi, this is [Your Name] from 314e. I'm trying to reach whoever handles document processing - things like faxes, referrals, lab results. Who would that be?"
If they say "we all do":
"Got it. Who would be the best person to talk to about making that process easier or faster?"
If they ask what it's about:
"We help medical practices automate document processing using AI, so staff doesn't have to spend so much time sorting and filing. Who should I talk to about that?"
If they offer to take a message:
"That would be great. Can you let [whoever] know that [Your Name] from 314e called about automating document processing to save staff time? My number is [number]. When's a good time to call back?"
