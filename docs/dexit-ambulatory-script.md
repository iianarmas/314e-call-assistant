61 Pitch: Specific to EHR/EMR

Subject: 
Streamlining Referrals for your [EHR Name] Workflow


Hi [First_Name],

I noticed that [Practice Name] uses [EHR Name]. 

At 314e, after working with several provider organizations for over 20 years, we  realize that managing the referral  process—especially from outside providers— is still painful.


Your team likely handles a flood of faxes and emails, manually enters patient data from referral forms into [EHR Name], and struggles to track the status of each case.


Our products, Dexit, bridges this gap. 

Dexit integrates with various EHRs  to create an automated referral management workflow that helps you to,
Instantly captures and reads all incoming referrals (fax, email, portal).
Automates insurance verification and routing of pre-authorization and other responses.
Increases staff accuracy and efficiency, allowing them to easily do more with their existing time.


This eliminates manual work, prevents patient leakage, and provides the ability to see the status of every referral in real-time.
Could I show you how we've helped provider organizations cut their referral processing time?

You can pick a slot <here-cal link> to book a quick 30 mins custom demo with our pre-built referral workflow.


Best regards,

Some questions: 


When you receive a document, whether via fax, email, or other methods, what is the typical journey for that document from arrival to being fully processed and accessible inside your EHR?
How do you process patient referrals? What are some common challenges you encounter in ensuring complete and timely information exchange for referrals, such as incomplete information or delays in scheduling?
Who is the first person to look at a new document, say a referral from another physician, and what's the first thing they do with it?
Are you able to push data elements from these documents directly into the EHR, or is it primarily stored as images or hyperlinks?
How do you handle documents for unregistered patients? What's the process for creating a new patient in the EHR?



Calling Script:

Hi ____, {First} from 314e Corporation a healthcare software and solutions company. If you have a moment to spare, I am curious to know how you currently manage various document workflows at your organization, and what is the typical journey for a document from arrival to being fully processed and accessible inside your EHR?

Short version: 

 If you have a moment to spare, I am curious to know how you currently manage clinical documents at your organization? 



Wait for the response and say: Thank you for sharing that vital information. What do you think is the most challenging bit of the process you just described and how many documents do you process on a daily or monthly basis? (If they just mention the number of documents, ask again about any challenges in their process)

Wait for the response and say: I have been calling a lot of leaders/users in the healthcare space and many share the same experience as yours. While it largely remains a common challenge, we have designed a solution that solves this problem. I’ll just need a minute to explain what I mean. 

Continue: Our product manager has been in the document management space for long enough to understand challenges in this space and designed an Intelligent Document Processing solution that uses AI and Machine Learning to automate tasks that are currently processed manually. While it sounds simple, it creates a ripple effect when you look at it from a process perspective. 

I’m sure you’ll love getting into a conversation with her after you meet one of our Subject Matter Experts who can analyze your use case before we demo. Do you have time this week or the next? 
***(If they hesitate - Offer a demo with Alyssa) - Alternatively, I can directly schedule a demo with our Product Expert to save some time. We can discuss your use case during the demo. 

Objections: 	

 “We don’t use <Greenway OR EHR you described” - My bad, which EHR do you use? “Customer responds”. Great! What I wanted to discuss applies to any EHR out there. Do you mind sharing the typical journey for a document from arrival to being fully processed and accessible inside your EHR?


“Whats the purpose of your call?” - The idea was to call an HIM leader from <Hospital> and understand how they currently handle documents and discuss if we can help solve any challenges. 

We’re all set: That's great! In recent times, AI and ML has changed the way we process documents in more ways than one. Can you spare 15 minutes to look at our version of it? I’m sure you’ll find it interesting. 

<<<DO NOT claim to have an existing integration with Greenway or any Ambulatory EHR. Just say “our solution has the capability to integrate with any EHR>>>

If Gatekeeper:

Gatekeeper: I wanted to talk to someone who manages document processing at your hospital/clinic.
Objection: What’s this about?
Response: I wanted to understand the current process and see if our AI powered solution can help speed up the process.
OR
I wanted to understand the current process to find if there are any pain points we can address using our AI powered document processing solution. 

VM 1: Hi ____, this is {First} from 314e Corporation, a healthcare software and solutions company. I was hoping to learn how you manage clinical documents at your organization and explore any challenges you face in processing documents for your EHR. I’d love to connect and discuss how our Intelligent Document Processing solution can help streamline your process. E-mail on the way from <Rep full name> and please visit 314.com to learn more.
