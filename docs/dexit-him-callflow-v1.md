HIM Manager/Director Call Flow
OPENING (Conversational & Clear)

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Natural Flow)
Start with easy ones, build rapport:

"What EHR are you using?"

Why: Shows you understand their environment

"How are documents coming into your department - mostly faxes, scans, both?"

Why: Identifies intake channels

"When a document arrives, what happens next? Walk me through it."

Let them talk - this is gold

"How much of that process requires someone on your team to actually touch it versus the system doing it on its own?"

Why: Reveals manual vs. automated tasks

"About how many documents does your team process in a day or week?"

Why: Scale understanding

"How many people on your team are involved in that process?"

Why: Resource allocation

"What's the most frustrating part of that whole process for you or your team?"

Why: Gets to the real pain point

"Are you using any kind of document management system right now, or is it mostly within your EHR?"

Why: Identifies competition/current state

TRANSITION TO PITCH
If they have Manual Processes:
"Got it. So it sounds like your team is spending a lot of time on tasks that could actually be handled automatically. That's exactly what we help with. Our system, Dexit, uses AI to do the heavy lifting - things like reading documents, figuring out what type they are, matching them to the right patient, and routing them where they need to go. All without your team having to touch them."
If they mention High Volume:
"Wow, [X] documents a day with a team of [Y]? That's a lot. What we do is take those repetitive tasks off your team's plate. Our AI can automatically identify document types, pull patient information, and get everything where it needs to be - so your team can focus on the exceptions instead of processing every single document manually."
If they mention errors/misfiles:
"Yeah, that's a common problem when everything's manual. Our AI is actually trained specifically on healthcare documents - it's looked at thousands of lab reports, referrals, clinical notes, all of it. So it gets really good at matching documents to the right patient and catching things that might get misfiled."

THE ASK
Keep it simple and low-pressure:
"Here's what I'd like to do: Let me connect you with one of our experts who can show you exactly how this would work with your [mention their EHR] setup and your specific process. It's usually about 15-20 minutes, and you'll see real examples of how the AI handles the documents. Would sometime this week or next work for you?"
Alternative ask:
"I think you'd find it really valuable to see this in action with your actual workflow. Our specialist can walk you through it - usually takes about 20-30 minutes. What does your calendar look like this week?"
