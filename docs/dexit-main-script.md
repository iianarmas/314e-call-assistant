NEW DEXIT SCRIPT [10-7-24]

Information Technology:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e Corporation a healthcare software and solutions company. Are you the <Job Title> for <XYZ>? I was curious to know if you’ve considered using AI for some of those repetitive tasks within your traditional document management system?

{Resonates with:
efficiency of applications, automation, security, the EHR/DMS they are currently using, and how we can integrate, worried about the impact of lack of automation?}

If no automation:
What if I tell you that we can automate several tasks that are repetitive in nature while you continue to use your existing DMS solution?

Health Information Management:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e Corporation a healthcare software and solutions company. If you have a moment to spare, I am curious to know how you currently manage the document workflow using <your EHR> and what is the typical journey for a document from arrival to being fully processed and accessible inside your EHR?

Wait for the response and say: Thank you for sharing that vital information. What do you think is the most challenging bit of the process you just described?

Wait for the response and say: I have been calling a lot of HIM leaders in the healthcare space and many share the same experience as yours. While it largely remains a common challenge, we have designed a solution that solves this problem. I’ll just need a minute to explain what I mean.

Continue: Our product manager has been in the HIM space for long enough to understand challenges and designed an Intelligent Document Processing solution that uses AI and Machine Learning to automate tasks that are currently processed manually. While it sounds simple, it creates a ripple effect when you look at it from a process perspective.

I’m sure you’ll love getting into a conversation with her after you meet one of our Subject Matter Experts who can analyze your use case before we demo? Do you have time this week or the next?

{Resonates with:
Clerical tasks, repetitive tasks, batch processing, have you thought of using automation with information capture?}

If no automaton:
Our intelligent document processing solution, Dexit, uses AI and machine learning to automate document classification and data extraction, significantly reducing manual indexing and errors. I’d like to schedule a 15-20 minute call for you to connect with one of our Subject Matter Experts to discuss our unique approach. Would you be available this week or next?

DEXIT OBJECTIONS

Not the Right Person:

For IT: I understand! I specifically wanted to talk to you or someone in the IT team since you may care about the efficiency of the applications and may also be thinking about introducing automation in applications. Is that on your mind?

For HIM: I understand! I specifically wanted to talk to you or someone in the HIM team to help automate those clerical tasks that can help increase efficiency and save time. We can automate all this while you continue to use your existing applications.

We're using OnBase: Great! Our tool effortlessly integrates with OnBase, automating many of your manual processes within OnBase. This significantly reduces the time spent on processing incoming documents.

<<<A product if need be can replace OB and has all the functionality - can also co-exist with onbase - automation capabilities compared to Onbase
Check with Alyssa - what are the USPs of dexit over onbase -
If Epic gallery - Very new intro in Oct 24….has limitations…only deals with clinical docs while Dexit has both clinical and non-clinical docs>>>

We use Cerner WQM: Great! Our solution Dexit can function as an intelligent automation layer that processes documents upon ingestion by seamlessly integrating with Cerner's WQM and helps make the process extremely efficient with the use of AI and Machine Learning. It can Automate E-Doc Prep, Perform AI Classification and Extraction and also automate existing workflows that are otherwise done manually. Are you willing to spare 15-20 minutes with one of our subject matter experts to understand how it works? We just want to demonstrate the capability of this solution and not lure you to buy something that you may not need.

Our current solution does that:

That's great! What exactly are you currently automating using this solution?

Listen to the prospect and say:
Are there any processes you'd like to automate but find your current system lacking the functionality?

Wait for the prospect’s response and say:
I’d like to schedule a 15-20 minute call for you to connect with one of our Subject Matter Experts to discuss our unique approach to automation. Would you be available this week or next?

We don’t use DMS:

This is precisely where we can help. Dexit not only automates document processing but also serves as a comprehensive AI-driven document management system. I’d like to schedule a 15-20 minute call for you to connect with one of our Subject Matter Experts to discuss our unique approach. Would you be available this week or next?

Not Interested

I understand! Are you currently using automation for any of your repetitive tasks? I am just curious to know how you currently tackle those.

I don’t have time:

I understand I caught you out of the blue. Can you suggest a good time we can talk about automating those day to day clerical tasks?

Already have a DMS:
Oh that's perfect, are all of your dreams coming true?
<ha ha> Our solution, called Dexit, can be used right alongside your current DMS - to do the same work, but better!
Nice, we also have a fax platform, are your DMS and Fax solution the same, or separate solutions?
Well, are you happy with it? <laugh> In a perfect world, what are some of the points where you say "I wish this Document Management System had xyz"? <let them talk> I would just love to hear your viewpoint. <let them talk> This is really valuable, thank you for this input, I'll be sure our Product team hears about this.

We have a contract - I get that, but when your team sees how compelling our functionality and pricing is, we'd like to be on your mind as an alternative.

Checking Epic Gallery - What are you most impressed with in Epic Gallery? <answer> Oh, that's a great feature, we're going to remain on the cutting edge and I'll mention that to our development team.

We don't want to be the beta team - I get that, testing is scary, but please know that we take Customer Service very seriously and we work closely with our customers. You will have an edge to guide how we improve Dexit to work closely with your internal workflows. <Focus on our Health IT services of 20 years>

We're not Interested, We have our inhouse Team
Thank you for sharing that, [Prospect's Name]. Having an in-house team is indeed a valuable resource. Our goal is not to replace your team but to complement and enhance their capabilities. Many organizations find that outsourcing specific `tasks can actually free up their internal resources for more strategic initiatives. May I share some insights on how partnering with us could bring additional value to your team?

I completely understand your perspective, and I want to assure you that our aim is to enhance your team's capabilities, not replace them. For instance, we've partnered with organizations with in-house teams similar to yours and have seen great results. They've been able to leverage our specialized expertise to address peaks in workload and focus their internal resources on strategic initiatives. Would you be open to exploring how this kind of partnership could work in your context?

Too Expensive!
Our services for HIM indexing and medical data abstraction offer a cost-effective solution that minimizes costly errors.

Faster processes reduce labor expenses, and by partnering with us frees up your team for strategic tasks.

By eliminating in-house overhead, you can achieve significant long-term savings while maintaining quality.

This isn't in my scope and we don’t use agency but thanks for the info.
I appreciate your honesty, and I understand that your current scope and preferences are well-defined.
It's great that you have clarity on your needs.

At the same time, I'd like to mention that we've worked with organizations in various capacities beyond agencies. Our approach is flexible and tailored to meet unique requirements.

While I completely respect your current stance, should your needs or circumstances evolve in the future,
we're here to discuss how our services could potentially align.

DMS OBJECTIONS

We heard that Epic is coming out with a DMS?
That's great you're open to alternatives. While Epic starts designing their solution, would you be open to looking at Dexit, which is ready now and even integrates with Epic? How about…
