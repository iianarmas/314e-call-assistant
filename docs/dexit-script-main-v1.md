HIM Manager/Director Call Flow
OPENING (Conversational & Clear)
Version 1 (Direct):
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from 314e. We work with healthcare organizations to help them process patient documents faster using AI. I'm calling HIM leaders like yourself because you're the ones who know exactly how time-consuming document processing can be. Do you have a quick minute?"
Version 2 (Question-led):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. Quick question - when a patient document comes in, whether it's a fax, scan, or upload, how much of that process is your team doing manually versus having the system do it automatically?"
Version 3 (Pain Point):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] with 314e. I've been talking to a lot of HIM managers lately, and they're telling me their teams are spending hours every day just sorting documents, matching them to the right patients, and getting them into the EHR. Is that something you're dealing with too?"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Natural Flow)
Start with easy ones, build rapport:

"What EHR are you using?"

Why: Shows you understand their environment

"How are documents coming into your department - mostly faxes, scans, both?"

Why: Identifies intake channels

"When a document arrives, what happens next? Walk me through it."

Let them talk - this is gold

"How much of that process requires someone on your team to actually touch it versus the system doing it on its own?"

Why: Reveals manual vs. automated tasks

"About how many documents does your team process in a day or week?"

Why: Scale understanding

"How many people on your team are involved in that process?"

Why: Resource allocation

"What's the most frustrating part of that whole process for you or your team?"

Why: Gets to the real pain point

"Are you using any kind of document management system right now, or is it mostly within your EHR?"

Why: Identifies competition/current state

TRANSITION TO PITCH
Based on their answers, use one of these:
If they have manual processes:
"Got it. So it sounds like your team is spending a lot of time on tasks that could actually be handled automatically. That's exactly what we help with. Our system, Dexit, uses AI to do the heavy lifting - things like reading documents, figuring out what type they are, matching them to the right patient, and routing them where they need to go. All without your team having to touch them."
If they mention high volume:
"Wow, [X] documents a day with a team of [Y]? That's a lot. What we do is take those repetitive tasks off your team's plate. Our AI can automatically identify document types, pull patient information, and get everything where it needs to be - so your team can focus on the exceptions instead of processing every single document manually."
If they mention errors/misfiles:
"Yeah, that's a common problem when everything's manual. Our AI is actually trained specifically on healthcare documents - it's looked at thousands of lab reports, referrals, clinical notes, all of it. So it gets really good at matching documents to the right patient and catching things that might get misfiled."

THE ASK
Keep it simple and low-pressure:
"Here's what I'd like to do: Let me connect you with one of our experts who can show you exactly how this would work with your [mention their EHR] setup and your specific process. It's usually about 20-30 minutes, and you'll see real examples of how the AI handles the documents. Would sometime this week or next work for you?"
Alternative ask:
"I think you'd find it really valuable to see this in action with your actual workflow. Our specialist can walk you through it - usually takes about 20-30 minutes. What does your calendar look like this week?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
"I'm not the decision maker"
Response:
"I totally understand - these decisions usually involve a few people. But here's why I wanted to talk to you specifically: you're the one in the trenches every day, right? You know exactly what's working and what's not. When your organization does evaluate solutions, your input is going to matter because you're the one who'll actually be using it.
How about this - let's schedule a quick demo just for you to see it first. That way, if it looks like something that could help your team, you'll have all the information when those conversations do come up. And if it's not a fit, no harm done. Does that make sense?"
Alternative:
"That's fine - who else would typically be involved in a decision like this? IT? Your director?"

Get names, then: "Would it make sense to have them join the demo too, or would you want to see it first and bring it to them?"

"We're all set / We're good"
Response:
"That's great to hear! Can I ask - what are you using now to handle your document processing?"
Listen, then:
"Got it. And is that system doing things automatically, or does your team still need to manually [classify/index/match] documents?"
If they say "manually":
"Okay, so here's the thing - when I say 'all set,' I'm wondering if it's more that you've gotten used to the process, or if the system is actually doing the work for you automatically? Because what we're seeing is that even organizations with document systems in place are still doing 70-80% of the work manually. And that's what our AI changes - it actually takes those manual tasks off your plate."
If they insist they're truly automated:
"That's awesome - you're ahead of the game. Most HIM departments I talk to are still doing a lot of this manually. Out of curiosity, what's it doing automatically?"
Listen for gaps, then:
"It might still be worth a quick look just to compare. Sometimes we find gaps that people didn't even realize were there. 15-20 minutes - what do you say?"

"We have [OnBase/Epic Hyperdrive/Cerner WQM/other system]"
OnBase:
"OnBase is solid - we actually work alongside OnBase all the time. Here's the thing though: OnBase is great for storage and workflow, but it's not doing the AI piece, right? Your team is still manually classifying documents, matching patients, all that? That's where we come in. We add an automation layer that works with OnBase - so OnBase stays, but your team does way less manual work. Want to see how that works?"
Epic Hyperdrive/Gallery:
"Got it - and that handles your clinical documents that are already structured from Epic, right? The challenge is with all the stuff coming from outside - faxes from other providers, scanned documents, referrals. That's where you still need people to process them manually. Our system handles all of that automatically and then feeds it into Epic. So think of us as filling the gap for everything Epic Gallery isn't designed to handle."
Cerner WQM (Work Queue Manager):
"Right, so WQM is handling your workflow and queues, which is great. But the documents are still landing in those queues for your team to manually process, correct? What we do is add intelligence on the front end - our AI processes the documents before they even hit your queues. It automatically figures out what they are, who the patient is, and routes them. So instead of your team processing 500 documents, they're only dealing with maybe 50 exceptions. We work right alongside Cerner - it's an add-on, not a replacement."
"We use [EHR] to manage documents":
"Okay, so you're keeping everything in [EHR name]. And when documents come in - let's say a fax or a scanned referral - what happens? Does the EHR automatically know what it is and who it belongs to, or does someone need to look at it and tell the system?"
They'll say someone needs to look at it.
"Exactly. That's the manual part we eliminate. Our AI looks at the document, figures out what it is, pulls the patient information, and gets it filed correctly - all automatically. Then it connects to your EHR so everything ends up where it needs to be. That's the difference."

"Not interested"
Response:
"No problem - can I ask what's driving that? Is it that you're happy with how things are working now, or is it just bad timing?"
If timing:
"Got it. Would it make sense to at least see what we do, so when the timing is better you know what's available? It's only 20 minutes."
If they're genuinely happy:
"Fair enough. Just out of curiosity - are you saying your team doesn't spend time manually sorting, indexing, or matching documents anymore? Because if you've figured that out, I'd love to know how you did it!"
They'll usually admit they still do manual work.
"Right. So maybe 'not interested' is really 'not sure this will help'? What if I could show you exactly how much time you'd save? That's what the demo does - it's specific to your process. Worth 20 minutes?"

"Send me information"
Response:
"I can definitely send you something, but honestly, it's hard to see how this works without a quick demo. The AI piece is really visual - you see it read the document in real time. Here's what I'm thinking: let me set up a 20-minute call with our specialist. You'll see it live with examples that look like your actual documents. After that, I'll send you everything. That way the information actually makes sense. Does Thursday or Friday work better for you?"
If they insist:
"Okay, I'll send something over. What's the best email? And what specifically should I include - are you more interested in how it handles patient matching, document classification, or the integration with your [EHR]?"
Send it, then follow up:
"Hey [Name], sent that info over. Did you get a chance to look at it? I know these things are easier to understand when you see them in action. Want to hop on a quick call this week?"

"How much does it cost?"
Response:
"That's a fair question. The pricing depends on a few things - how many documents you're processing, what parts of the system you need, and how it integrates with your [EHR]. What I can tell you is that we price it based on actual usage, so you're only paying for what you need.
Most organizations find that the time it saves their team pays for itself pretty quickly. That's something our specialist can walk through with you based on your specific volume. Want to set up that call?"

CLOSING
"Awesome. Let me grab a couple of times from you. What does [this week/next week] look like?"
Get 2-3 time slots, then:
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite to [email]. You'll be meeting with [SME name], and they'll walk you through exactly how this works with your setup. Sound good?"
