Competitor-Specific Objection Handling Deep Dive

1. OnBase (Hyland)
What They'll Say:

"We already have OnBase"
"We've been using OnBase for years"
"OnBase does everything we need"
"We just upgraded our OnBase system"

What You Need to Know:
OnBase is a document management and workflow platform - it's strong on storage, retrieval, and workflow routing, but it's NOT AI-native. It requires manual configuration, doesn't have built-in intelligent document processing, and the user experience is often clunky.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"OnBase is solid infrastructure - a lot of organizations use it. Can I ask you a quick question: when a document comes into OnBase - let's say a fax or a scanned referral - does OnBase automatically know what type of document it is and which patient it belongs to, or does someone on your team need to tell it?"
They'll say someone needs to tell it.
"Right. That's the manual piece we eliminate. OnBase is great at storing and routing documents once they're classified and indexed, but it doesn't do the intelligent processing part. That's where our AI comes in."

Deeper Objection Handling:
"OnBase has AI features"
Response:
"They've added some AI capabilities recently, but it's not their core strength. OnBase's AI is an add-on module that requires significant configuration and training. Our system is AI-native - meaning it's built from the ground up with AI, specifically trained on healthcare documents.
Here's the difference: with OnBase, you're still configuring document types, training the system, managing exceptions. With Dexit, the AI already knows what a lab report looks like, what a referral is, how to pull patient demographics. It's ready out of the box. Want to see the difference?"

"We've customized OnBase to our workflows"
Response:
"That's actually pretty common, and I'm sure it took a lot of time and resources to get it set up the way you need it. Here's the thing though: we're not asking you to replace OnBase. We can work alongside it.
Think of it this way: OnBase handles your workflow and storage, which is great. We handle the intelligent processing on the front end - automatically classifying, indexing, and matching documents to patients. Then it flows into OnBase already processed. So all those custom workflows you built? They still work. Your team just isn't doing all the manual classification work anymore."

"OnBase integrates with our EHR"
Response:
"Right, and that integration stays. We're not disrupting that. What we do is add an automation layer before documents even get to OnBase. Documents come in, our AI processes them automatically, and then they flow into OnBase and ultimately into your EHR. The integration you already have doesn't change - we're just making the front-end processing automatic instead of manual."

"We just renewed our OnBase contract"
Response:
"That's fine - we're not asking you to get rid of OnBase. Most of our clients who use OnBase keep it. What they're adding is the intelligent processing layer that makes OnBase work better. You're already paying for OnBase, so why not make it more efficient? The ROI comes from your staff spending less time on manual indexing, not from replacing OnBase."

"OnBase is too expensive to replace"
Response:
"I completely agree - and we're not asking you to replace it. That would be a massive undertaking. What we're suggesting is adding intelligence on top of OnBase so you get more value out of the investment you've already made. Think of us as making OnBase smarter, not replacing it."

"Our IT team built custom OnBase modules"
Response:
"That's impressive - it shows OnBase wasn't doing what you needed out of the box. But here's the question: how much time and resources is your IT team spending maintaining those custom modules? Every time OnBase updates, do those modules need to be reworked?
What if you could offload that? We handle all the AI development and updates. Your IT team just manages one integration, and they're done. No more custom development and maintenance. Wouldn't that free them up for other projects?"

Bottom Line for OnBase:
"OnBase is a document management system. We're an intelligent document processing system. They're complementary, not competitive. OnBase stores and routes. We classify and automate. Together, they're better than either one alone."

2. Epic (Hyperdrive/Gallery)
What They'll Say:

"We use Epic for everything"
"Epic is releasing a document management system"
"Epic Hyperdrive handles our documents"
"We're waiting for Epic Gallery"

What You Need to Know:
Epic is the EHR, not a full document management system. Epic Hyperdrive is their integration framework. Epic Gallery is their newer document viewing/management capability, but it's primarily designed for clinical documents already in Epic, not outside documents like faxes, referrals from non-Epic facilities, or unstructured incoming documents.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"Epic is a great EHR - you're not getting rid of that. But here's the question: when documents come in from outside Epic - faxes from other providers, referrals, prior auths, lab results from non-Epic facilities - does Epic automatically process those, or does someone on your team need to manually get them into Epic?"
They'll say manually.
"Exactly. Epic is designed for clinical documentation that's created within Epic. Everything else - the outside stuff - still requires manual processing. That's what we automate. We handle all those external documents automatically and then feed them into Epic. So Epic stays, but the manual work goes away."

Deeper Objection Handling:
"Epic is releasing a document management system / We're waiting for Epic Gallery"
Response:
"Yeah, Epic has been talking about that for a while now, and Gallery is starting to roll out in some places. But here's the reality: Epic Gallery is designed primarily for viewing and managing clinical documents that are already in Epic - things like scanned progress notes, consent forms, images that are part of the Epic record.
What it's not designed for is intelligently processing external documents - faxes from non-Epic providers, referrals, prior auths, insurance cards. Someone still needs to process those to get them into Epic. That's where we come in.
Plus, even if you do end up using Gallery, we can work alongside it. But in the meantime, why wait months or years when you could be solving this problem now? How long has Epic been talking about this? Are you willing to keep doing manual processing that whole time?"

"Epic Hyperdrive handles our integrations"
Response:
"Right, Hyperdrive is Epic's integration framework - it's how systems connect to Epic. And actually, we integrate with Epic via Hyperdrive, so that's perfect. But Hyperdrive doesn't do document processing - it's just the connection. Someone still needs to classify documents, match them to patients, and index them before they go into Epic through Hyperdrive. That's the manual piece we automate."

"We only use Epic - we're an Epic-only shop"
Response:
"That makes sense - a lot of organizations are Epic-focused. But here's the thing: not every organization you work with uses Epic, right? You get faxes from non-Epic providers, referrals from clinics that use Cerner or Athena, prior auths from insurance companies. Those documents don't come through Epic - they come from outside. And someone on your team has to manually process them to get them into Epic.
That's what we automate. We're not disrupting your Epic environment - we're making it easier to get outside documents into Epic. We integrate with Epic, so it's seamless."

"Epic has AI features now"
Response:
"They do - Epic is adding AI capabilities for clinical documentation, predictive analytics, things like that. But Epic's AI is focused on clinical workflows within Epic. It's not focused on processing external documents.
Our AI is purpose-built specifically for intelligent document processing - it's trained on thousands of healthcare documents to automatically classify, extract data, and match to patients. Epic's AI does a lot of things; document processing isn't its specialty. Want to see what purpose-built document AI can do?"

"We're doing an Epic upgrade right now"
Response:
"Perfect timing, actually. When you're doing an Epic upgrade, the last thing you want is a backlog of unprocessed documents. Having automation like ours in place before the upgrade means documents are processed and ready to migrate, not sitting in a queue waiting for manual processing.
Plus, getting this implemented now means your team has one less manual task to worry about during go-live. Want to see how it would fit into your timeline?"

"Epic is our single source of truth"
Response:
"Absolutely - and we're not changing that. Epic stays your source of truth. All we're doing is making it easier to get documents into Epic. Right now, someone has to manually process external documents to get them into your single source of truth. We automate that process. Epic is still where everything lives - we just make it faster and easier to get documents there."

Bottom Line for Epic:
"Epic is your EHR. We're not replacing your EHR. What we do is handle the intelligent processing of external documents before they go into Epic. Think of us as the AI layer that makes getting documents into Epic automatic instead of manual."

3. Cerner (Oracle Health) / Cerner WQM (Work Queue Manager)
What They'll Say:

"We use Cerner for everything"
"Cerner WQM handles our document workflows"
"We have Cerner's document management"

What You Need to Know:
Cerner is the EHR. WQM (Work Queue Manager) is their workflow and queue management tool - it routes documents to queues for processing, but it doesn't do intelligent classification or patient matching. Someone still has to manually process documents in those queues.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"Cerner is solid - you're not getting rid of that. Can I ask: when documents come into Cerner or into WQM queues, is Cerner automatically figuring out what type of document it is and which patient it belongs to, or does someone need to review it and tell the system?"
They'll say someone needs to review it.
"Right. That's what we automate. WQM is great at routing documents to the right queues, but someone still needs to process the documents in those queues. Our AI does that processing automatically - classification, patient matching, data extraction - before it even hits the queue. So instead of your team processing 500 documents in a queue, they're only dealing with maybe 50 exceptions."

Deeper Objection Handling:
"Cerner WQM handles our workflows"
Response:
"WQM is great for workflow management - it routes documents to the right queues and manages work assignments. But here's the thing: documents still land in those queues for your team to manually process, right?
What we do is add intelligence on the front end. Our AI processes documents automatically - classifies them, matches them to patients, extracts data - before they even hit your WQM queues. So WQM stays, your workflows stay, but now most documents flow through automatically instead of piling up in queues waiting for manual processing. Think of us as making WQM work smarter."

"We have Cerner Scanning and Indexing"
Response:
"Right, so Cerner has scanning capabilities. But scanning is just getting the document into the system - someone still needs to tell Cerner what it is and who it belongs to, correct? That's the indexing piece, and that's manual work.
Our AI automates that indexing. The document gets scanned, our AI immediately classifies it, matches it to the patient, extracts relevant data, and it's done. Your team only touches it if there's an exception. So you can keep using Cerner for scanning, but now the indexing happens automatically."

"We're on Oracle Health now (Cerner rebranded)"
Response:
"Right, Oracle acquired Cerner. The platform is still essentially the same. And the same challenge exists - external documents coming into Oracle Health still require manual processing to get them properly classified and matched to patients. That's what we automate. We integrate with Oracle Health just like we would with Cerner, and we make that document processing automatic."

"We're switching from Cerner to Epic (or vice versa)"
Response:
"That's a huge project. Here's the thing though: no matter which EHR you're on, the challenge of processing external documents doesn't go away. You're still getting faxes, referrals, prior auths from outside your EHR. And honestly, having document automation in place before you switch makes the transition easier, not harder.
When you migrate, you want documents already processed and organized, not a backlog of unprocessed documents to deal with. Plus, our system works with both Cerner and Epic, so we can support you through the transition."

"Cerner has AI features coming"
Response:
"They've announced some AI initiatives, but the reality is that EHR vendors are focused on clinical AI - predictive analytics, clinical decision support, those kinds of things. Document processing isn't their core focus.
We're purpose-built for intelligent document processing. Our AI is trained specifically on healthcare documents - it knows what a lab report looks like, how to extract patient demographics, how to classify different document types. It's ready now, and it's what we specialize in. Want to see the difference?"

Bottom Line for Cerner:
"Cerner is your EHR and WQM manages your queues. We're not replacing either of those. We're adding intelligent automation on the front end that processes documents before they hit your queues. Cerner stays, WQM stays, but your team does way less manual work."

4. Athena (athenahealth/athenaOne)
What They'll Say:

"We use Athena for everything"
"Athena is cloud-based, so it's already modern"
"Athena handles our documents"

What You Need to Know:
Athena is primarily a cloud-based practice management and EHR system popular with ambulatory/smaller practices. It has basic document management, but it's not AI-powered. Documents still require manual classification and indexing.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"Athena is a great system - especially for practices your size. But when documents come in - faxes, referrals, lab results from outside - does Athena automatically know what they are and which patient they belong to, or does someone on your staff need to review them and file them?"
They'll say staff reviews them.
"Right. That's the manual piece we eliminate. Athena stores the documents, but someone still has to do the classification and indexing work. Our AI handles that automatically, so it flows into Athena already processed. Your staff only touches exceptions."

Deeper Objection Handling:
"Athena is cloud-based and modern"
Response:
"Absolutely - Athena being cloud-based is great. But cloud-based doesn't automatically mean AI-powered. The documents still need to be classified and matched to patients, and that's manual work right now. We add the AI layer that makes that processing automatic. And because we're also cloud-based, we integrate seamlessly with Athena."

"Athena has built-in faxing"
Response:
"They do have fax capabilities. But when a fax comes in through Athena, what happens next? Someone still needs to look at it, figure out what it is, match it to the patient, and file it, right? That's what we automate. Our virtual fax server with AI processes faxes automatically - no more sorting through faxes manually. Want to see how that works?"

"We're happy with Athena"
Response:
"That's great - you should keep using Athena. We're not asking you to switch. What we're saying is that we can make Athena work even better for you by automating the document processing piece. All the time your staff spends sorting and filing documents? That happens automatically. Athena stays - your staff just has more time for patients."

Bottom Line for Athena:
"Athena is your practice management and EHR system. We're not replacing that. We're automating the document processing that happens before documents get into Athena. Think of us as making your Athena investment work harder for you."

5. eClinicalWorks (eCW)
What They'll Say:

"We use eClinicalWorks"
"eCW has document management built in"
"We're happy with eCW"

What You Need to Know:
eClinicalWorks is another ambulatory EHR/practice management system. It has basic document scanning and storage, but no intelligent processing. Very manual.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"eCW is solid. Question: when documents come in - faxes, referrals, whatever - does eCW automatically classify them and match them to patients, or is someone on your staff doing that manually?"
They'll say manually.
"Right. eCW stores the documents, but the processing is manual. That's what we automate with AI. Documents get processed automatically and flow into eCW ready to go. Your staff only deals with exceptions."

"eCW has scanning and document management"
Response:
"They do - you can scan documents into eCW. But scanning is just getting the image into the system. Someone still needs to tell eCW what the document is, who it belongs to, and where it should be filed. That's the manual indexing work. Our AI does that automatically. Scan it, and it's done - no manual indexing required."

Bottom Line for eCW:
"eCW is your EHR. We automate the document processing before it gets into eCW. Keep eCW, eliminate the manual document work."

6. Nextgen
What They'll Say:

"We use Nextgen"
"Nextgen handles our documents"

What You Need to Know:
Nextgen is another ambulatory EHR with basic document capabilities. Same story - manual processing.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"Nextgen is a good system. When documents come in, is Nextgen automatically processing them, or is your staff manually filing them?"
Manual.
"That's what we fix. We automate the processing, it flows into Nextgen automatically. Nextgen stays, manual work goes away."

7. "We built our own system" / "We have an internal solution"
What They'll Say:

"Our IT team built something custom"
"We have our own document management system"
"We developed an internal solution"

Your Response:
Initial Response:
"That's impressive - most organizations don't have the resources to build custom solutions. Can I ask: how much ongoing development and maintenance does that require from your IT team?"
They'll admit it requires resources.
"Right. And every time you need new functionality or your clinical teams want changes, that's more development work. Plus, if the person who built it leaves, you've got knowledge transfer issues.
Here's the question: is maintaining a custom document processing system really the best use of your IT team's time? What if you could offload that to us - we handle all the development, AI training, updates, and maintenance - and your IT team just manages one integration and moves on to other priorities? Wouldn't that free them up for projects that are actually strategic to your organization?"

"Our system does exactly what we need"
Response:
"That's great. But here's the thing - 'exactly what we need' today might not be 'exactly what we need' next year. As your volume grows or requirements change, can your system scale? Does it have AI capabilities? Is it keeping up with modern healthcare interoperability standards?
Even if it's working now, it's worth seeing what purpose-built, AI-native document processing looks like. You might find there are capabilities you didn't even know you needed. Want to at least compare?"

8. RightFax (OpenText)
What They'll Say:

"We use RightFax"
"RightFax handles our faxing"

What You Need to Know:
RightFax is a fax server - it handles sending and receiving faxes, but it doesn't do intelligent processing. Faxes still need to be manually sorted, classified, and filed.
Your Response Framework:
Initial Response:
"RightFax is a solid fax server. But when a fax comes in through RightFax, what happens next? Someone still needs to print it or open it, figure out what it is, match it to a patient, and file it, right?"
Yes.
"That's what we eliminate. Our virtual fax server includes AI that automatically processes faxes the moment they arrive. No printing, no manual sorting. The AI classifies the document, matches it to the patient, and routes it where it needs to go. You can get rid of RightFax entirely and have faxing plus intelligent processing in one system. Want to see what that looks like?"

"RightFax works fine"
Response:
"I'm sure it does what it's designed to do - send and receive faxes. But it's not making your life easier beyond that, right? Our system doesn't just handle faxing - it intelligently processes the faxes. And honestly, for what you're probably paying for RightFax plus the staff time to process faxes manually, our solution is more cost-effective and way more functional."

"We just renewed RightFax"
Response:
"Got it. How long is the contract? Because here's the thing - even if you're stuck with RightFax for now, you can see what modern fax processing looks like so you know what's available when that contract is up. Plus, we can actually work alongside RightFax in the interim if needed. Want to at least see what you're missing?"

9. "We're evaluating multiple vendors"
What They'll Say:

"We're looking at several solutions"
"We're in the middle of an RFP process"
"We have a few vendors we're considering"

Your Response:
"That's great - it's smart to look at multiple options. Can I ask: who else are you looking at?"
Listen to their list.
"Makes sense. Well, if you're already in evaluation mode, you should definitely add us to the comparison. We're probably different from what you're seeing because we're AI-native - built from the ground up with intelligent processing, not a traditional DMS with AI bolted on.
What would be helpful is if we could show you our system so you can compare apples to apples. Sometimes when organizations see ours, it changes their evaluation criteria because they realize there are capabilities they didn't even know were possible. Want to add us to your list? It's just 30 minutes."

Universal Competitor Response Template
Use this when you're not sure about their system:
"That's a good system for [what it does]. Quick question: when a document comes in from outside - a fax, referral, whatever - does [their system] automatically know what type of document it is and which patient it belongs to, or does someone on your team need to review it and tell the system?"
→ They'll almost always say someone needs to review it.
"Right. That's the manual piece we eliminate with AI. [Their system] is great for [storage/workflow/EHR/whatever], and we're not asking you to replace it. We're just adding intelligent automation on the front end so your team isn't doing all that manual work anymore. Want to see how that would work with your [their system] setup?"

Key Principles for All Competitor Objections:

Never trash the competitor - acknowledge they're a legitimate solution
Ask questions first - understand what they're actually using it for
Identify the gap - find the manual work that still exists
Position as complementary - we make their existing system better, not replace it
Offer proof - "Want to see how that works?" ends every response
Focus on outcomes - less manual work, more automation, better efficiency
