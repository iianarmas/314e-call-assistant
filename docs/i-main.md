IT/Applications Manager/Director Call Flow
OPENING (Conversational & Clear)
Version 1 (Tech Integration Angle):
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from 314e. We help healthcare organizations automate their document processing with AI that integrates directly with EHRs. I'm reaching out to IT leaders because you're the ones who need to make sure these systems actually work together. Do you have a quick minute?"
Version 2 (Problem-Solver Angle):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. Quick question - how many applications in your environment are your clinical teams complaining about because they're slow, clunky, or require too much manual work? I'm asking because we help reduce that workload with AI automation for document processing."
Version 3 (Efficiency Angle):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] with 314e. I've been talking to IT leaders who are being asked to find ways to make their teams more efficient without adding headcount. We've got a solution that automates document processing - things like classification, patient matching, and routing - all with AI. Is that something you'd want to hear about?"
Version 4 (Direct Tech Approach):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. We've built a cloud-native, AI-powered document processing platform that integrates with [their EHR if you know it]. I'm calling IT folks because you need to know this thing will actually work in your environment without creating more problems. Got a minute to hear what it does?"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Tech-Focused Flow)
IT/Apps people care about integration, security, support burden, and whether it actually works:

"What EHR platform are you on?"

Why: Critical for integration discussion

"What are you using now for document management - is it built into your EHR, or do you have a separate system like OnBase or something else?"

Why: Identifies current tech stack

"How does that integrate with your EHR - HL7 feeds, APIs, manual uploads?"

Why: Shows you understand integration complexity

"What kind of support burden does that system create for your team - is it stable, or are you constantly putting out fires?"

Why: Pain point around maintenance

"When HIM or Revenue Cycle comes to you asking for improvements - more automation, better workflows, faster processing - what's currently limiting what you can do for them?"

Why: Gets at constraints - budget, resources, system limitations

"How much manual configuration does your current system require when things need to change - like adding new document types or routing rules?"

Why: Reveals administrative burden

"Are you hosting your document management on-prem, or is it cloud-based?"

Why: Infrastructure preferences

"What's your team's appetite for adding new systems right now - are you in growth mode, or are you trying to consolidate?"

Why: Timing and readiness assessment

"From an IT perspective, what would need to be true for you to consider a new document processing solution?"

Why: Uncovers their decision criteria

TRANSITION TO PITCH
Based on their answers, choose your angle:
If they mention integration challenges:
"Yeah, integration is always the concern, and rightfully so. Here's what's different about our system: it's built to integrate with EHRs from the ground up. We support HL7 messaging, APIs, and we have pre-built integrations with Epic, Cerner, and others. So it's not some bolted-on solution - it's designed to fit into your existing environment. And because it's cloud-native, there's no hardware for you to manage, no on-prem servers to maintain."
If they mention support burden:
"That's exactly why we built this the way we did. Our system is cloud-native, which means updates and maintenance happen automatically - you're not patching servers or managing upgrades. And from a support perspective, it's intuitive enough that HIM and Rev Cycle can manage their own workflows without constantly coming to IT. You set up the integration once, and it just runs."
If they mention wanting to reduce manual work:
"Right, and that's where the AI comes in. Instead of your end users manually classifying every document, matching patients, and routing things, the AI does it automatically. It's trained on healthcare documents specifically, so it actually understands what it's looking at. Your users only touch exceptions. From an IT perspective, that means fewer tickets, fewer complaints, and happier end users."
If they mention system limitations:
"Got it. So your current system is probably doing basic document storage, but it's not doing the intelligent processing piece, right? That's what we add. Our AI layer sits in front of your existing systems and does the heavy lifting - document classification, patient matching, data extraction - before it even gets to your EHR or document management system. So you're not replacing anything; you're making what you have work better."
If they mention consolidation/simplification:
"That makes sense - nobody wants more systems to manage. Here's the thing: we can actually help with consolidation. If you're using multiple point solutions for faxing, document scanning, and processing, we can replace those with a single platform. Everything comes in through us - fax, scan, upload, API - gets processed automatically, and then goes to your EHR. One system, one integration, less for you to support."

THE ASK
IT people want to see how it works technically:
"Here's what I'd like to do: Let me connect you with one of our technical specialists who can walk you through the architecture, show you how the integration works with [their EHR], and answer any questions about security, scalability, and deployment. It's usually about 30 minutes. Would this week or next work better for you?"
Alternative ask (Technical Deep Dive):
"I think you'd want to see this from a technical perspective - how the APIs work, what the data flow looks like, how we handle security and compliance. Our specialist can do a technical walkthrough and answer any architecture questions you have. Usually takes about 30 minutes. What does your calendar look like?"
Alternative ask (Collaborative Approach):
"Since this touches both IT and the clinical side, sometimes it makes sense to have both on the call - maybe you and your HIM director or whoever manages those workflows. Would you want to see it together, or would you rather look at it from the IT side first?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
"I'm not the decision maker"
Response:
"I get it - these decisions usually involve multiple stakeholders. But here's why I wanted to talk to you: when your organization evaluates new systems, you're the one who has to make sure it actually works, right? You're the one who'll be asked 'can we integrate this?' and 'will this create support issues?'
How about this - let's get you on a technical demo so you can evaluate it from an IT perspective. That way, when those conversations happen, you'll know if it's even feasible. And if it's not a fit technically, we'll both know early. Does that make sense?"
Alternative:
"Totally fair. Who else would typically be involved in evaluating something like this? Your CIO? Application owners? Clinical leadership?"

Get names, then: "Would it make sense to have them on the call too, or would you want to vet it technically first?"

"We're all set / We're good"
Response:
"That's good to hear. Can I ask - what are you using now for document processing?"
Listen, then:
"Got it. And from an IT support perspective, how's that working? Are you getting a lot of tickets, or is it pretty stable?"
If they mention tickets/issues:
"Okay, so there might be room for improvement there. What we're built to do is reduce that support burden. The system is intuitive enough that end users can manage their own workflows without coming to IT all the time. Worth a look?"
If they say it's stable:
"That's great. How about on the functionality side - when HIM or Rev Cycle asks for new automation or capabilities, can your current system do that, or are there limitations?"
They'll usually mention limitations.
"Right. That's where we're different. Our AI can handle pretty much any workflow they throw at it, and they can configure it themselves without needing IT to custom-build something. Might be worth seeing what that looks like?"

"We have [OnBase/Epic/Cerner/other system]"
OnBase:
"OnBase is solid infrastructure. But here's the question: is OnBase doing AI-powered document classification and patient matching, or is that still manual work for your end users? Because OnBase is great at workflow and storage, but it's not doing the intelligent processing piece. We add that layer on top, so OnBase stays - you're not replacing infrastructure - but now your users aren't manually processing every document. From an IT perspective, it's one integration, and then it just works."
Epic:
"Epic is your EHR, so you're not getting rid of that. But Epic's not designed to be a full document management and automation system, right? Especially for outside documents - faxes from other providers, referrals, prior auths - your team is still manually processing those to get them into Epic. That's what we automate. We sit in front of Epic, handle all the document processing automatically, and feed it into Epic via HL7 or API. So it's not replacing Epic; it's making the work of getting documents into Epic way easier."
"We're evaluating Epic's new document management system":
"Yeah, Epic has been talking about that for a while. Here's the reality: even when they release it, it's going to be designed primarily for Epic-to-Epic workflows. What about all your outside documents - faxes, scans, referrals from non-Epic providers? That's where we come in. And honestly, even if you end up using Epic's system, ours can work alongside it. But in the meantime, why wait months or years when you could be solving this problem now?"
Cerner:
"Cerner has document capabilities, but it's not doing AI-powered automation, right? Your users are still manually classifying, matching patients, and routing. What we do is add intelligence on the front end. Documents come in, our AI processes them automatically, and then they flow into Cerner. From an integration standpoint, we use standard HL7 feeds or APIs, so it's straightforward. You're not replacing Cerner - you're making it work smarter."
"We built something internally":
"That's impressive - most organizations don't have the resources to build that. Can I ask - how much ongoing development and maintenance does that require from your team?"
They'll usually admit it's a burden.
"Right. And that's the thing - you've got a million other priorities, and maintaining a custom document processing system probably isn't the best use of your team's time. What if you could offload that to us? We handle all the development, updates, and AI training. Your team just manages the integration and moves on to other projects. Worth considering?"

"Not interested"
Response:
"No problem - can I ask what's driving that? Is it that you don't see the need, or is it more about timing or priorities?"
If timing/priorities:
"Fair enough. Would it make sense to at least see what we do from a technical perspective, so if priorities shift or if leadership starts asking about document automation, you already know what's available? It's 30 minutes, and you might find it changes your planning."
If they don't see the need:
"Got it. Just curious though - are you not getting any pressure from your clinical teams about document processing being too slow or manual? Because we're hearing that from a lot of organizations."
They'll usually admit there are complaints.
"Right. So maybe it's not 'not interested' as much as 'I've got bigger fires to put out'? What if I could show you something that would actually get those clinical teams off your back? Worth 30 minutes?"

"Send me information"
Response:
"I can definitely send you something, but honestly, the technical architecture is hard to appreciate on paper. What I'd recommend is a 30-minute technical demo where our specialist walks through how the integration works, what the API structure looks like, security and compliance, all the things you'd need to know. Then the documentation we send after will make way more sense. Does Thursday or Friday work for you?"
If they insist:
"Okay, I'll send over some technical documentation. What's your email? And what specifically should I focus on - integration architecture, security and compliance, deployment options, or something else?"
Send it, then follow up:
"Hey [Name], I sent over that technical overview. Have you had a chance to look through it? I know this stuff is easier to evaluate when you can see it working and ask questions in real time. Want to hop on a call this week so our technical team can walk you through it?"

"How much does it cost?"
Response:
"That's the right question. Pricing depends on your volume and which modules you need - document processing, faxing, workflow automation, etc. What I can tell you is that it's a subscription model based on usage, so you're not making a massive capital investment.
The best way to get accurate pricing is to have our specialist understand your environment - how many documents you're processing, what integrations you need, whether you want cloud hosting or need on-prem. They can give you a real quote based on that. Want to set that up?"
Alternative (if they push):
"I don't want to throw out a number that's not accurate for your situation. But I can tell you we're typically more cost-effective than traditional document management systems because of how we're architected. Let's get you on a call where we can talk through your specific needs and give you real numbers. Does [day/time] work?"

"We don't have budget"
Response:
"I totally get it - budget is always tight. Here's the thing though: when you look at what your team is spending on manual document processing - in terms of FTE hours, errors, delays - there's usually budget hidden in there. A lot of IT leaders find that automating this actually frees up budget because they're not hiring additional staff or dealing with constant support issues.
It's worth at least seeing what the numbers look like. Our specialist can show you the cost versus the savings based on your volume. Then you can make an informed decision about whether it's worth pursuing budget for. What do you think?"
Alternative:
"Fair enough. When does your next budget cycle open up? It might make sense to see this now so you can plan for it in next year's budget. That way when the time comes, you've already got the business case built."

"We're not adding any new systems right now / We're consolidating"
Response:
"That makes total sense - nobody wants more complexity. But here's the thing: we can actually help with consolidation. If you're using separate systems for faxing, scanning, document routing, and workflow management, we can potentially replace multiple systems with one platform. So instead of adding to your stack, you're simplifying it.
It's worth a look to see if we could actually reduce the number of systems you're managing. Want to have that conversation?"
Alternative:
"I get it. But here's what I'm hearing from a lot of IT leaders: they're being asked to do more with less, and their clinical teams are still complaining about manual work. At some point, you need tools that actually solve problems without creating new ones. That's what we're built to do. Worth 30 minutes to see if it could actually make your life easier?"

"Security concerns / We need to go through IT security review"
Response:
"Absolutely - security is critical, especially in healthcare. We're SOC 2 Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliant, and all data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We can provide all the documentation your security team needs.
What I'd suggest is getting you on a technical demo first so you can see how the platform works. If it looks like a fit functionally, then we can engage with your security team and provide whatever they need for their review. Does that make sense?"
Alternative:
"That's expected - every organization has a security review process. What's helpful is if we can show you the platform first, so you know if it's even worth starting that process. If it is, we've got all the security documentation ready to go - we've been through this with dozens of healthcare organizations. Want to see the platform first?"

"We need to standardize on fewer vendors"
Response:
"That's smart - vendor sprawl is a real problem. Question for you: if we could replace multiple point solutions with one platform - faxing, document processing, workflow automation - would that align with your consolidation strategy?"
If yes:
"That's exactly what we do. Let me show you how we could potentially reduce your vendor count instead of adding to it."
If they're locked into specific vendors:
"I get it. But here's the thing - we integrate with whatever you're standardizing on. So if you're all-in on Epic or you've got OnBase as your standard, we work alongside those. We're not asking you to rip and replace; we're adding intelligence to what you already have. Worth seeing how that integration works?"

"We're in the middle of an EHR implementation/upgrade"
Response:
"That's a big project. Here's the thing though - this could actually make that implementation easier, not harder. If you're migrating to a new EHR, having documents automatically processed, classified, and matched to patients before migration is way better than migrating a backlog of unprocessed documents.
Plus, it's better to have automation like this in place before go-live, so your teams aren't drowning in manual work during the transition. Want to at least see how it could fit into your implementation timeline?"
Alternative:
"I totally get it - you've got your hands full. When do you go live? It might make sense to schedule a demo for after go-live when things settle down. Or, if you want to see it now while you're in planning mode, we can talk about how it could support your go-live. What makes more sense for you?"

CLOSING
"Great. Let me grab a couple of times from you. What does your availability look like [this week/next week]?"
Get 2-3 time slots, then:
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite to [email]. You'll meet with [SME name], who can walk through the technical architecture and answer any integration or security questions. If it makes sense to include anyone else from your team - maybe your security lead or whoever manages [their DMS/EHR] - feel free to add them. Sound good?"
