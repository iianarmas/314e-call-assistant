Script for Opportunities:

Cerner to Epic:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e Corporation, a software and solutions company. I understand <name of the org> is transitioning its EHR from Cerner to Epic and many organizations we work with find the process of data migration and archival to be one of the most complex aspects of an EHR transition, specifically, getting a comprehensive backup of Cerner data for historical access. I was curious if you've already mapped out your strategy for ensuring seamless access to your legacy Cerner data once you've gone live with Epic?

Wait for response and say: Our 20 years of experience in healthcare IT enabled us to develop a unique approach that bypasses the need for traditional Cerner backups for migration. Our solution directly reads live Cerner data and seamlessly integrates it into your new Epic system. This significantly reduces the effort and complexity typically associated with these transitions.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call with one of our Subject Matter Experts? They can quickly demonstrate how this works and discuss how it could benefit your specific transition

For Opps:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e Corporation, a software and solutions company. I understand <name of the org> is transitioning from [Legacy EHR] to Epic and I was curious if you have considered a strategy for archiving and converting your EHR data as part of this process?

About 314e: We have over 20 years of experience with data archival and conversion and have worked with over 250+ hospitals. We recently helped Broward Health with data archival and conversion.

If someone doesn't understand why you are calling: Apologies for any confusion, as you transition to Epic EHR, you need to archive and convert your existing medical records so they're readily available within the new EHR system.

Epic to Epic (Upgrade):

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from a healthcare IT company. I understand you are moving to a new instance of Epic and I was curious if you have finalized plans around data archival and conversion.

For mergers and acquisitions:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from a healthcare IT company. I understand Orlando Health has recently acquired 3 Steward Florida hospitals and I was curious if you have considered a strategy for archiving and converting your EHR data as part of this process?

Yes, we have it covered / already have a solution: Excellent! How about I schedule a time for you to speak with one of our Subject Matter Experts who can also introduce you to an organization that’s gone through a similar EHR migration? I’m confident it would be valuable.
Wait for the prospect to respond and ask: Out of curiosity which archival solution have you decided to use?
Yes - Schedule Meeting

No - I get it, I’d still recommend a quick 30 minutes meeting with our Subject Matter Expert on this matter since we have 20 years of experience with data archival and conversion and I am sure we can add value to this EHR migration process. We won’t ask you to make any decisions on that meeting, it's just a demo of our capabilities and your feedback will be valuable.

No: This is exactly why I called, we’ve helped hospitals and health systems archive and convert their legacy data and we have over 20 years of experience in this area. I am sure a quick 15 minutes meeting with our Subject Matter Expert would be very valuable in explaining how this transition works.

OR

No: This is exactly why I called, we are a healthcare IT company with over 20 years of experience helping hospitals and health systems with data archival and conversion. Our archival solution is FHIR native and makes your legacy data available as soon as you go-live with your new EHR. How about I schedule a 15 minute meeting with our SME to show you how it works?

To check for RFP:

By any chance, do you know if there is an RFP released for archival and conversion of your EHR data?

Wait for response and then ask……..Who can I call to get registered as a preferred vendor with you?

Temp/WIP:
Yes, we have it covered / already have a solution: Great! Which archival solution will you be using? <Wait for response> and say “Since you're still in the early stages of this process, would you be open to exploring our FHIR-native solution? It ensures seamless access to your legacy data from the moment you go-live with your new EHR”

No: This is exactly why I called, our FHIR-native data archival solution ensures your legacy data is accessible from the moment you go-live with a new EHR or application. How about I schedule a time with one of my Subject Matter Experts this week or the next?

Would you be interested in hearing from another org that has gone through the same migration process?

Opening Epic - No opportunity:

For Epic: Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e Corporation. I understand you're using Epic EHR and was curious if you're working on acquiring smaller practices or hospitals that might need help with archiving or converting data while you transition them to Epic?

No or we’re all set: Sounds like things are going great. If that's the case, I'm not sure if our FHIR native data archival solution can help. Does that check out with you, or am I missing a piece to the puzzle?

If Yes:
Great! I know I caught you out of the blue so I’d like to set a time for you to connect with one of our Subject Matter Experts to discuss our unique approach to the archival process. Would you be available for 15-20 minutes this week or next?

Non-Epic:

Hi \_\_\_\_, {First} from 314e. I am calling to check if there are any initiatives underway to retire a legacy system that you don’t use anymore or if you plan to replace your current EHR or convert its data?

If they ask the reason for this question: I’m asking because we offer a FHIR-native healthcare data archive solution that ensures your legacy data is accessible from the moment you go-live with a new EHR or application.

Let them answer.

If Yes, then …… Great! I know I caught you out of the blue so I’d like to set a time for you to connect with one of our Subject Matter Experts to discuss our unique approach to the archival process. Would you be available for 15-20 minutes this week or next?

Prospect Response: I’m not the person responsible for that.
Inside Response: Oh, got it, who might we chat with about retiring those legacy systems and discuss the unique features of our archive software?
OR
Oh, got it, who might we chat with about our solution that helps archiving data of old applications or EHR?

(Note: Hopefully the prospect gives a name. If not, hopefully they’ve answered the question and we can dig for someone else who might be the right contact.)

If already on Epic:
Are you acquiring any smaller practices, hospitals or planning to engage in a community connect?

If No, then ……

I understand, are there any future expansions or new services being considered that could potentially require the archival of old data…..while keeping it easily retrievable when needed?

If they still say no to the above:

I understand. What's the best way to make sure we’re on your mind when you need an archival solution.

If unable to answer any technical questions:
I’m not certain I can provide a detailed response to this question, but our subject matter expert will be able to address it. Would you be available for 15-20 minutes this week or next?

Already have a solution:
I see! Which solution have you subscribed to and does it go-live concurrently with your new EHR……or have you experienced implementation delays?
When does your contract end with the current vendor? Would you be open to considering our solution before you extend your contract?
Does it have SSO (Single Sign-On) integration?
Do they keep increasing your yearly costs?
Are there any delays or issues with retrieving older records quickly?

If they say no to the above:

I understand. What's the best way to make sure we’re on your mind when you are considering new options?

Questions to uncover the need for archival/Discovery Questions:
Are there any upcoming projects or expansions that could potentially lead to an EHR migration? Our solution can manage both clinical and non-clinical data
How do you currently manage data that needs to be retained but may not be frequently accessed?
Have you considered the cost implications of maintaining all data on high-performance storage versus using a storage approach with archival solutions?

Objections:

No Budget - I hear you, is there an older solution you're maintaining that may be using up that budget?

EMR implementation stage - What EMR are you moving to, if you're moving to Epic would you like to see how we integrate smoothly?

No Archiving Problems - That is awesome! What are the top 2 features that you just love and can't live without?

We don't want to be the beta team - I get that, testing is scary, but please know that we take Customer Service very seriously, and we work closely with our customers. Muspell is an established product with a full feature set. <Focus on our Health IT services of 20 years>
