Revenue Cycle Manager/Director Call Flow
OPENING (Conversational & Clear)
Version 1 (Direct):
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from 314e. We work with healthcare organizations to help speed up how patient documents get processed - things that impact billing, authorizations, and claims. I'm calling Revenue Cycle leaders because you're dealing with a lot of documents that can slow down reimbursement. Do you have a quick minute?"
Version 2 (Question-led):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. Quick question - when documents come in that you need for billing - like referrals, prior auths, insurance cards - how long does it typically take from when they arrive to when your team can actually use them?"
Version 3 (Pain Point):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] with 314e. I've been talking to a lot of Revenue Cycle managers, and they're telling me that delays in getting documents processed - prior auths, referrals, insurance verification - are creating bottlenecks that push out their reimbursement timelines. Is that something you're seeing too?"
Version 4 (Money-focused):
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] from 314e. I work with Revenue Cycle teams to help them get paid faster by cutting down the time it takes to process the documents you need for claims - prior auths, medical records, referrals. Is this something you'd be interested in hearing about?"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Natural Flow)
Revenue Cycle leaders care about speed, accuracy, and cash flow. Frame questions around those themes:

"What EHR are you using?"

Why: Understanding their tech stack


"What types of documents does your team deal with most - prior auths, referrals, insurance verification, medical records for appeals?"

Why: Identifies their document-heavy processes


"When those documents come in - whether it's a fax, email, or upload - what has to happen before your team can actually use them for billing or claims?"

Let them explain the process


"How much of that is someone on your team manually handling versus the system doing it automatically?"

Why: Reveals manual bottlenecks


"How many of those documents are you processing daily or weekly?"

Why: Volume = ROI potential


"When there's a delay in getting those documents processed, how does that affect your timelines - claims submission, denials, AR days?"

Why: Connects to their KPIs


"What's the biggest headache for your team when it comes to document processing?"

Why: Pain point discovery


"Are you using a document management system, or is everything going through your EHR or maybe HIM?"

Why: Identifies workflow and potential collaboration points




TRANSITION TO PITCH
Based on their answers:
If they mention delays/slow processing:
"Yeah, and every day those documents sit waiting to be processed is a day you're not submitting claims or getting paid. That's exactly what we solve. Our system uses AI to automatically process those documents the moment they arrive - it reads them, pulls out the information you need, matches it to the right patient and claim, and gets it where it needs to go. So instead of waiting days, you're talking hours or even minutes."
If they mention prior auth delays:
"Prior auths are the perfect example. Right now, someone has to receive it, figure out which patient it's for, match it to the right authorization request, and get it to the right person. Our AI does all of that automatically. It reads the document, identifies it as a prior auth, pulls the patient info and auth details, and routes it exactly where it needs to go. Your team only sees it if there's an exception. Everything else just flows through."
If they mention denials/appeals:
"Denials are expensive, and a lot of times it's because the documentation wasn't there when you needed it. Our system makes sure those medical records, test results, whatever you need to support a claim - it's all processed and available immediately. The AI matches it to the patient, links it to the encounter or claim, and makes it accessible right away. So when you're responding to a denial, you're not hunting for documents."
If they mention insurance verification:
"Insurance verification is such a time-suck when it's manual. Our system can automatically capture insurance cards when they come in - whether it's a fax, scan, or photo - extract the policy information, and even verify eligibility through API connections. So your team isn't typing in insurance details from blurry fax copies anymore."

THE ASK
Revenue Cycle leaders respond to ROI and efficiency:
"Here's what I'd like to do: Let me connect you with one of our specialists who can show you exactly how this would work for your [prior auth/referral/appeals] process. They'll walk through real examples and we can talk about the time savings based on your volume. Usually takes about 20-30 minutes. Would this week or next work better for you?"
Alternative ask (ROI-focused):
"I think you'd find it really valuable to see the numbers on this. Our specialist can show you how much time you'd save based on your volume, and what that means for your cash flow. It's about 20-30 minutes. What does your schedule look like?"
Alternative ask (Collaborative):
"Here's the thing - this touches both Revenue Cycle and HIM, so sometimes it makes sense to have both departments see it together. Would it be helpful to include your HIM director, or would you want to see it first?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
"I'm not the decision maker"
Response:
"I completely get that - these decisions usually involve a few departments. But here's why I specifically wanted to talk to you: you're the one measuring AR days, dealing with claim delays, and managing denials, right? When your organization evaluates tools like this, they're going to ask you 'will this actually help us get paid faster?' And you'll want to have an answer.
How about this - let's get you on a quick demo so you can see if this would actually move the needle for your metrics. That way, when those conversations happen, you'll know exactly what this could do. And if it's not a fit, no problem. Does that work?"
Alternative:
"Totally understand. Who else would typically be involved? IT? HIM? Your CFO?"

Get names, then: "Would it make sense to have them on the call too, or would you want to see it first and loop them in after?"


"We're all set / We're good"
Response:
"That's good to hear! Can I ask - when documents come in that you need for billing or claims, how automated is that process?"
Listen, then:
"Okay, so if your team is still manually [matching documents to claims/entering data/routing prior auths], then there's probably room to speed that up, right? Because what I'm hearing from most Revenue Cycle teams is that even when they have systems in place, they're still doing a lot of the work manually - which means delays.
What if I told you our AI could handle all of that automatically? Worth a quick look to see what the time savings would be?"
If they insist they're truly automated:
"That's impressive - you're ahead of most organizations. Out of curiosity, what's handling the automation for you?"
Listen for gaps, then:
"Got it. It might still be worth comparing notes, especially if we can show you ways to cut even more time out of the process. 20 minutes - what do you think?"

"We have [OnBase/Epic/Cerner/other system]"
OnBase:
"OnBase is a solid document system. But here's the thing - is OnBase automatically processing your prior auths, referrals, and insurance documents, or is your team still having to manually classify and route them? Because OnBase is great for storage and workflow, but it's not doing the AI piece. That's where we come in. We add the automation layer that works with OnBase, so the documents get processed automatically before they even hit your team. Want to see how that would work?"
Epic:
"Epic is great for clinical workflows, but when it comes to outside documents - prior auths from payers, referrals from other providers, insurance cards - your team is still processing those manually to get them into Epic, right? That's exactly what we automate. Our AI handles all of that upfront work, and then it feeds into Epic. So instead of your team spending hours on document processing, it's happening automatically in the background."
"We're waiting for Epic to release their document management system":
"Yeah, I've heard that too - Epic's been working on that for a while. But here's the reality: while you're waiting, you're still processing documents manually, which means delays and bottlenecks. Our system is ready now, it integrates with Epic, and when Epic does release theirs, you'll have already been operating more efficiently for months or years. Plus, we can work alongside whatever Epic releases. Why wait and lose money when you could be saving time now?"
Cerner:
"Cerner has document capabilities, but is it automatically handling all your Revenue Cycle documents - prior auths, referrals, insurance verification? Or is someone still manually processing them? Our AI layer sits on top of Cerner and handles all of that automatically, so your team only touches exceptions. It's not replacing Cerner - it's making it work better for you."
"HIM handles all of that":
"Got it - so HIM is processing the documents, and then they get to you. But here's the question: how long does that take? Because we're hearing from a lot of Revenue Cycle teams that waiting for HIM to process documents is creating delays in billing and claims. Our system can process documents automatically for both departments - so HIM gets what they need, and you get what you need for billing, all at the same time. Want to see how that workflow would look?"

"Not interested"
Response:
"No problem - can I ask what's behind that? Are you happy with your current process, or is it just not the right time?"
If timing:
"Fair enough. Would it make sense to at least see what we do, so when the timing is right or when budget opens up, you know what's available? It's only 20 minutes, and you might find it changes your planning."
If they're genuinely happy:
"That's great. Just curious though - you're saying your team doesn't have any delays with documents for prior auths, claims, or denials? Because if you've figured out how to make that seamless, I'd honestly love to know how you did it."
They'll usually admit there are still delays.
"Right. So maybe it's less about 'not interested' and more about 'I'm not sure this will actually help'? What if I could show you exactly how much time and money you'd save based on your volume? That's what the demo does. Worth 20 minutes to see the numbers?"

"Send me information"
Response:
"I can definitely send you something, but here's the thing - the ROI is really hard to show on paper without seeing how it works with your specific processes. What I'd recommend is a quick 20-minute demo where our specialist walks through your workflow - prior auths, referrals, whatever your biggest volume is - and shows you the actual time savings. Then the information we send after will actually mean something. Does Thursday or Friday work for you?"
If they insist:
"Okay, I'll send something over. What's your email? And what should I focus on - are you most interested in prior authorization processing, insurance verification, claims documentation, or something else?"
Send it, then follow up:
"Hey [Name], I sent over that information. Have you had a chance to look at it? I know this stuff makes way more sense when you see it in action with real examples. Want to hop on a quick call this week so I can show you what the ROI would look like for your team?"

"How much does it cost?"
Response:
"That's the right question to ask. The pricing depends on your volume - how many documents you're processing - and which workflows you need it for. What I can tell you is that most Revenue Cycle teams see ROI within the first few months because of how much time it saves and how much faster they can submit claims.
The best way to get an accurate number is to have our specialist look at your specific volume and workflows. They can show you the cost and the time savings side by side. Want to set that up?"
Alternative (if they push):
"I don't want to give you a number that's not accurate for your situation. But I can tell you this - it's priced per document processed, so you're only paying for what you actually use. And when you see how much time it saves your team, the math usually works out pretty quickly. Let's get you on a call so you can see the real numbers. Does [day/time] work?"

"We're working on [insert internal project/EHR upgrade/other initiative]"
Response:
"That makes sense - you've got a lot going on. Here's the thing though: this actually makes those projects easier, not harder. If you're doing an EHR upgrade, having documents automatically processed and ready to migrate is way better than migrating a backlog of unprocessed documents. And if you're working on internal improvements, this takes one big problem off your plate so your team can focus on those other priorities.
It's worth a quick look to see if this could actually support what you're already working on. Want to schedule it for after things settle down a bit, or would you rather see it now while you're in planning mode?"

CLOSING
"Great. Let me get a couple of times from you. What's your availability looking like [this week/next week]?"
Get 2-3 time slots, then:
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite to [email]. You'll meet with [SME name], and they'll walk you through exactly how this speeds up your Revenue Cycle processes and what the time savings would look like. If it makes sense to include anyone else from your team - maybe HIM or IT - feel free to add them to the invite. Sound good?"
